# FOODOSCOPE HACKATHON

### Personalized Vegetarian Food Recommendation Dashboard 🍽️

## Overview
Foodoscope is a data analytics project that recommends vegetarian meals by
balancing nutritional health, cultural preference, and flavor profile.
The recommendations are ranked using a personalization score and visualized
through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## Problem Statement
“Food discovery platforms today focus on recipes and nutrition, but they fail to address the real challenge of personalization at scale: people want meals that fit their health goals, cultural identity, and flavor preferences simultaneously. Current apps either give generic recipes or calorie counts, but they don’t bridge the gap between science of flavor, health needs, and cultural diversity. As a result, users struggle to cook food that is healthy, tasty, and culturally meaningful.”

## Solution
Foodoscope provides:
- Personalized meal recommendations
- Filters based on cuisine, vegan preference, calories, and protein
- Clear visual insights for health and flavor balance
- Explainable ranking through a personalization score

## Dataset

- Calories
- Protein
- Cuisine
- Flavor group
- Vegan flag

## Tools Used
